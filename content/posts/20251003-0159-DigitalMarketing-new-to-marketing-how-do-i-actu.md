It's a great starting point because everyone is on social media, and businesses are always looking for help here. You can start by offering to manage social media accounts for local businesses or friends. Practice by creating engaging posts and observe which ones get the most interaction. This experience will teach you what works and what doesn’t, building a strong foundation for your marketing skills.

Content creation involves making material that attracts and engages an audience. This could be anything from blog posts and videos to infographics and podcasts. Content is king in digital marketing because it's how you connect with people. Start by creating content that interests you. Share tips, stories, or how-to guides that can help others. Use free online tools to make your content look professional. By building a portfolio of your work, you can show potential clients or employers your capability and style.
