**How I Grew a Roofing Startup and Made Less Than a Cashier**

Starting a business sounds like a dream come true, especially when you take a startup from zero to $2.2 million in 18 months. But what if you end up making less than a McDonald's cashier? This story is about a digital marketer who did just that. Let's explore how this happened and what we can learn from it, especially if you’re into digital marketing.

**Key Lesson 1: Undervaluing Your Work**

One important reason for earning less than expected is undervaluing your services. In the digital marketing world, knowing your worth is crucial. The marketer in this story charged too little for the value they provided. By doubling the charge, they could have earned much more. It's important to set a fair price for your work to reflect the effort and results you deliver. Remember, your skills in digital marketing are valuable, and proper pricing is key.

**Key Lesson 2: Exploring Payment Models**

Another valuable insight is choosing the right payment model. Instead of sticking to one-time fees, consider a flat retainer plus a percentage of revenue. This method ensures you’re paid consistently and rewarded for helping the business grow. In digital marketing, this model can motivate you to deliver better results since your earnings increase as the company succeeds. It’s a win-win situation for both the marketer and the business.

**Key Lesson 3: Repeating Success in Other Sectors**

Even though the marketer made less money, they gained an invaluable experience. This success story can be replicated in different sectors, but with a better pricing strategy. By applying the same digital marketing techniques and charging appropriately, you can achieve similar results elsewhere. This story highlights the importance of learning from past experiences to improve future ventures.

In summary, this journey teaches us the significance of valuing your work, considering flexible payment methods, and applying successful strategies across different industries. By learning from this experience, digital marketers can ensure they’re fairly compensated for their hard work.
