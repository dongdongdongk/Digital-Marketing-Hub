Digital marketing is a growing field, and many people are eager to jump in and start a career. This area includes a variety of tasks from managing social media to optimizing websites for search engines, commonly known as SEO (Search Engine Optimization). If you're considering a career in digital marketing, it's important to understand how SEO works and why it's a crucial part of the field. Let's break down the basics to help you get started.

2. **User Experience (UX)**: This means making your website easy and enjoyable for visitors to use. If people have a good experience, they're more likely to stay longer and return.

3. **Content**: Great content that answers questions or solves problems for your audience is key. Good content can attract visitors and encourage them to share your site with others.

4. **Off-site SEO**: This involves getting other websites to link to yours, which can improve your search ranking.

As things shift, you adjust your strategies to fit the new landscape. There's always an opportunity if you're willing to learn and adapt.
