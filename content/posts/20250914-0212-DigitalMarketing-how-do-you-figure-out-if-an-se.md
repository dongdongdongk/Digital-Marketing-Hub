### How to Know if Your SEO Agency is Really Working for You

Hiring an SEO agency can feel like a big step towards growing your online presence. But how can you be sure they're actually delivering results and not just sending you fancy reports? For those new to digital marketing, it’s important to focus on what really matters. This means looking beyond the reports and understanding the real changes in your business performance. Here’s a simple guide to help you figure it out.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Matter

When you hire an SEO agency, you should agree on specific goals. These are often called Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). KPIs should relate directly to your business goals, like increasing sales or getting more people to sign up for your newsletter. Good KPIs for SEO might include more people visiting your website from search engines, better rankings for important keywords, or an increase in sales coming from organic searches. If your agency can't show improvement in these areas, their reports may not mean much.

#### Track Real Progress

Seeing your website move up in search rankings is a good sign. Even if you're not on the first page yet, moving from page 7 to page 3 is progress. These changes should be part of the regular updates from your agency. Use tools like Google Analytics to see how visitors are finding your site. Are more people coming from search engines? Are they staying longer or buying more? These are signs that your SEO is working.

#### Focus on Business Goals

Your business goals should always guide what you track. If getting more inquiries is your goal, then measure how many inquiries come from organic searches. If selling products online is your goal, track sales. Reports from your agency should match these goals. If the core goals aren't achieved, then the reports are not useful. Always ask your agency to connect their work to your business outcomes.

### Summary

To know if your SEO agency is really working, focus on KPIs that matter to your business. Look for real progress in search rankings and traffic. Always tie results back to your business goals. If reports don't show improvement in these areas, the agency might not be delivering the results you need.
