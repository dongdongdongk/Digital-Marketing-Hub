**Beginner Tips for Starting a Successful Ad Campaign with Meta or Google Ads**

Starting an ad campaign on platforms like Meta (formerly Facebook) or Google Ads can be exciting. It's a chance to show off your skills and boost your junior portfolio. If you're just starting, don't worry—everyone begins somewhere, and your interest in learning is your first step towards success. Having some basic IT skills can also give you a head start. Let's dive into some easy-to-follow tips that will help you create an effective ad campaign, even if you're a beginner.

First, educate yourself with available resources. YouTube is a goldmine of information. Search for "Meta ads tutorial" or "Google Ads tips," and you'll find plenty of videos from the last couple of years. Watch these videos and take notes on important strategies and tools. This will help you understand the basics and give you a clearer idea of what to focus on when setting up your first campaign.

Second, if possible, get hands-on experience. Real projects often require you to invest your own money, which can be a bit daunting. A good alternative is to join a search marketing agency as a junior employee. This way, you can gain practical experience without the financial pressure. Working in a team with more experienced professionals can provide valuable insights and help you learn faster.

Finally, don't hesitate to seek feedback. Connecting with others in the digital marketing community can be incredibly helpful. Whether it's through online forums, social media groups, or direct messages, asking for feedback can improve your campaign skills. Sometimes, exchanging reviews or tips with peers can lead to new ideas and better results for your ads.

**Key Takeaways:**

To start a successful ad campaign on Meta or Google Ads, use online resources to learn the basics, gain practical experience through a job or personal projects, and seek feedback from others in the community. These steps will help you improve your skills and create effective campaigns.
